# Car Buying Decision Tree Project


## Objective
Using fundamental data structures and algorithms, solve real-world problems with trees.


## Problem    
Ahmed is going to work on the metro, but his company decided to change the office location, and unfortunately, the metro station is far away from the new office. Now he is thinking about buying a car. Help him by building a decision tree to decide which car to buy.

## Implementation

- You should build a decision tree storing the questions.
- For each question, the user will answer (input) with either yes or no.
- If the answer was no for any question, the program will print ("Don't buy the car").
- If the answer was yes, the program should move to the next question until the last one.


### Run time example

```OUTPUT
System: Do you have the car budget?

System: Do you need the car?

System: Can you drive?
User: Yes
System: Do you have a driving license?
User: Yes
System:    
Buy a car
```
