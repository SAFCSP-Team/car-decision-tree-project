# Car Decision Tree Project


## Objective
Using fundamental data structures and algorithms, solve real-world problems with trees.


## Problem    
Ahmed is going to work on the metro, but his company decided to change the office location, and unfortunately, the metro station is far away from the new office. Now he is thinking about buying, and a decision tree will help him to decide.


## Implementation

- You will be given a list of questions stored in an array.    
- You should build a decision tree storing these questions.
- For each question, the user will answer (input) by either yes or no.
- If the answer was no for any question, the program will print ("Don't buy the car").
- If the answer was yes, the program should move to the next question until the last one.


### Run time example

```OUTPUT
System: Do you have the car budget?   
User: Yes   
System: Do you need the car?
User: Yes   
System: Can you drive?
User: Yes
System: Do you have a driving license?
User: Yes
System:    
Buy a car
```
